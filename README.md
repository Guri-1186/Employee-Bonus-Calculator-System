# Employee Bonus Calculator System

This project calculates monthly bonuses for an insurance company's call center employees based on performance metrics and employment categories. The system evaluates two types of bonuses:

1. **Salary Step Bonus**  
   - Fixed bonus amounts based on employment status (Full-time or Part-time) and performance thresholds (Efficiency Rate and Acceptance Rate).

2. **Performance-based Bonus**  
   - Percentage-based bonus determined by Customer Rating, Efficiency Rate, and IMED Information Ratio.

### Features
- **Dynamic Bonus Calculation:** Fixed and performance bonuses based on employee data.
- **Category Assignment:** Employees classified into performance categories (I, II, or III) for bonus computation.
- **IMED Ratio Adjustment:** Adjusts performance bonuses with bonuses/reductions based on data entry quality.
- **Exclusion Reporting:** Identifies employees who do not qualify for bonuses.
